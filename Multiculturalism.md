## Exponents

### 1️⃣ Will Kymlicka  
**Book:** *Multicultural Citizenship – A Liberal Theory of Minority Rights*

- Liberal multiculturalist  
- Liberalism is about **tolerating other cultures**, not just liberty  
- Universal citizenship ignores differences → leads to homogenisation  
- Equal citizenship builds community but not enough to address alienation  
- Ignoring multiculturalism leads to **color blindness**

### Special Rights for Minorities

- Cultural & educational rights  
- Special representation rights  
- Self-government rights  
- Judicious affirmative action  
- State support for minority institutions  

**Limitation:**  
Special rights only for **national minorities**, not immigrants (they came by choice).

**Dworkin link:**  
People should not suffer for circumstances they did not choose (being born in minority).

---

## Indian Context

- Constitution supports multiculturalism  
  - Articles **29 & 30** (minority rights)  
  - **Fifth & Sixth Schedule** (tribal rights)  
- Example: **Ganga-Jamuna Tehzeeb** (Hindu–Islamic cultural intermixing)

## Bhikhu Parekh  
**Book:** *Rethinking Multiculturalism*

- Plural multiculturalist  
- Criticises Kymlicka’s liberal extension view  
- Special rights should include **non-citizen minorities**  
- Human principles cannot be based on one culture  
- Must emerge from **dialogue between civilizations**  
- Praises India’s multicultural handling  

### Harm Principle
Minorities can follow cultural practices if they do not harm society or state security.

2. Every culture is plural  
3. Every culture has its own idea of good life  

### Raimon Panikkar
- Calls for **diatopical dialogue** between cultures
