# Marxist Theory of State

---

## Core Idea

- State is part of **superstructure**, reflection of **economic base**
- Base (means of production) controlled by capitalists → state also controlled by capitalists
- **Engels** (*Origin of Family, Private Property and State*) — Force Theory  
  → State not social contract, but forced upon weak by strong

---

# Instrumentalist School

- Derived from **Communist Manifesto**
- State = **executive committee of capitalist class**
- Neutrality of state = **false consciousness**
- State is class institution → workers cannot expect justice
- Goal → **stateless society**

### Basis

- Historical materialism  
- Class struggle  
- **Lenin** — State represents irreconcilability of class conflict  
- **Engels** — When freedom exists, there will be no state  

### Thinkers

1. Marx  
2. Lenin  
3. Ralph Miliband — *The State in Capitalist Society*  
   - Welfare state is myth  
   - Wealth still in few hands

# Structuralist School

Came as criticism of instrumentalists.

- Focus on **superstructure**
- State not merely tool; capitalists also need state
- Called **Relative Autonomy Theory**
- State appears neutral in normal times, but in crisis supports propertied class

### Core Argument

- State sometimes seems to help workers (wages, unions)  
  → Actually preserving capitalism by preventing uprising
- Inspired by Marx’s **18th Brumaire of Napoleon Bonaparte**  
  → Concept of **Bonapartism** (strong executive)

### Relative Autonomy

Occurs when:
- Feudal class strong  
- Capitalists strong  
- Workers organised  
→ No class fully controls state → state gains bargaining power  

But during crisis state saves capitalism:
- 2008 financial crisis rescue of bankers  
- West Bengal Nano protests repression  

---

## Key Thinkers

1. **Gramsci** — Civil society makes state appear autonomous  
2. **Althusser** — Ideological State Apparatus & Coercive State Apparatus  
3. **Nicos Poulantzas** — *Political Power and Social Classes*

### Poulantzas

- Structural Marxist → importance to superstructure  
- State seeks equilibrium in plural society  
- Cannot always serve one class  
- Universal adult franchise → state becomes relatively autonomous  
- Welfare measures necessary because poor majority

# Managerial Revolution Debate

**James Burnham** — Power shifting from capitalists to managers  
**Miliband** — Rejects; MBA expensive → managers still elite class

---

# Miliband vs Poulantzas Debate

- Miliband → **Instrumentalist**  
  - State serves capitalists due to social origins & personal ties of elites  
- Poulantzas → **Structuralist**  
  - State objectively capitalist regardless of individuals  
  - Reproduces capitalist mode of production  

---

# Structural Marxism — Long vs Short Term Interests

- State serves **long-term interests** of bourgeoisie  
- Regulates class conflict to preserve system  

### Short-term interests:
- Tax breaks  
- Lower wages  
- Subsidies  

### When state helps workers:
- To prevent revolution  
- Stabilise capitalism  

State ensures survival of capitalism even if capitalists resist reforms.

---

## Conclusion

State in capitalism functions to **regulate class conflict** and preserve system existence.
