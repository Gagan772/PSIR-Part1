# Neo-Marxist Analysis of Post-Colonial State

## Instrumentalist Approach

- Given by third world scholars for third world  
- Neo-colonialism still continues — **Kwame Nkrumah**

### World Structure

- **Core** — G7  
- **Periphery** — Third World  
- **Semi-Periphery** — BRICS  

### Dependency School

- Periphery states are instruments of bourgeoisie of core countries  
- Examples: Middle East wars, Indo-US nuclear deal, Afghanistan war profits  

#### Thinkers

1. **Lenin** — Expansionism inherent in capitalism; colonies = dependency  
2. **Andre Gunder Frank** — Development of underdevelopment  

### Samir Amin

- Cut ties with core countries  
- Book: *Accumulation on a World Scale*  
- Concept: **Imperialist Rent**
- USA = “Empire of Chaos”
- Calls for multipolar world (Europe + China + India + Russia)

## Immanuel Wallerstein — World Systems Theory

- No third world; single interconnected world  
- Periphery sells cheap, buys expensive → unequal exchange  
- US hegemony declining  
- Capitalism harmful to masses  
- Advocates **National Autonomous Development**

---

## Contemporary Neo-Marxist View

- **Data Colonialism**
- Sensitive data of developing countries stored in US servers → influence

---

# Cosmopolitan Liberal View

- Rawls’ TOJ extended to global sphere  
- Global distributive justice  

---

# Structuralist / Relative Autonomy Approach

### Hamza Alavi

- Instrumentalism fits only fully developed capitalism (West)  
- Civil society weak in postcolonial states  

### Over-Developed State Theory

- Political structure (state) fully developed  
- Socio-economic structure still transitional  
- Mismatch due to colonial legacy  
- Strong state machinery imposed by colonial rulers  

### Features

- **Bureaucratic-Military Complex**
- Three exploiting classes:
  1. Indigenous bourgeois  
  2. Metropolitan neo-colonialist bourgeois  
  3. Landed classes  

- Conflicting interests → state becomes **relatively autonomous**
- Strong executive → **Bonapartist State**
- State appropriates surplus for development  
- Political parties inherit independence legitimacy → dominant state  

### India Example

- LPG reforms + PRI to reduce gap between state and society

### Nature of Over-Developed State

- Highly bureaucratised  
- Despotic tendencies  
- Hero worship prevalent
