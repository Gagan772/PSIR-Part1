# General Topic: State, Sovereignty, Liberal Theory & Globalisation

---

## Intro

- Study of **state** is one of the most important concepts in normative political theory.

---

## Sovereignty

**Jean Bodin:** “Supreme power over citizens and subjects, unrestrained by law.”

---

## Theories of Sovereignty

### Monistic Theory

**Exponents:**
- **Hobbes** — supremacy of positive law over natural/customary law; sovereignty permanent, inalienable, indivisible  
- **John Austin** — *Lectures on Jurisprudence*

---

### Pluralist Theory

- Monistic theory = legal fiction  
- State’s sovereignty limited internally by associations & externally by other actors  
- State not sole institution fulfilling human needs  
- Monism arose to end medieval chaos; pluralism to prevent war recurrence

#### Harold Laski

- In federal society, authority should also be federal  
- Monism → totalitarian threat to peace & human rights  
- Impossible to find Austinian sovereignty in federal state  
- Allegiance to associations is partial & proportional  
- “Concept of sovereignty should be surrendered”

#### R. M. MacIver (Extreme Pluralist)

- Concept of **Service State** → state formed to serve people  
- Law exists prior to state; state gives it definite shape  
- Family, kinship prior to and independent of state  

**Moderate Pluralists:**
- State most important institution  
- Keeps society together  
- Authority to make law must be shared  

---

### Critical Evaluation of Pluralists

- Want to keep state but limit it → contradiction  
- Yet realistic today due to decentralisation demand  
- **Narrow Corridor** → “Shackled Leviathan” = balance between state & society  

---

# Globalisation and State

**Thomas Friedman — *The Lexus and the Olive Tree***  
Globalisation = inexorable integration of markets, nation-states, technology  
Interactions become farther, faster, cheaper, deeper  

### Context

- Origin of state via social contract (Hobbes, Locke)  
- State as evolving institution (MacIver)  
- Westphalian “billiard ball” model

---

## Three Schools on Globalisation & Sovereignty

### 1. Globalists

- State power declining  
- Shift from billiard ball → cobweb model  
- Rise of transnational actors → post-sovereign governance  
- MNCs challenge sovereignty  
- IMF SAP limits welfare spending  
- WTO Agreement on Agriculture restricts policy  

**Thinkers:**
- Marshall McLuhan — Global Village  
- Kenichi Ohmae — Borderless world  
- Thomas Friedman — World is flat, deterritorialisation  

---

### 2. State-Centric

- **Robert Gilpin** — state prime actor; shells of sovereignty intact  
- Post 9/11, 2008 crisis, COVID → state power expanded  
- **Md Ayoob** — “Nation-state is alive”  
- **Stanley Hoffmann** — states prioritise national interest  
- China: state control over corporates; Great Firewall  

---

### 3. Transformationalists

- Globalisation & sovereignty not zero-sum  

**David Held** — balanced view  
**Bob Jessop** — both trends coexist  
**Georg Sorenson** — unequal impact; weaker states affected more  

---

## Gated Globalisation

- Threats: terrorism, organised crime  
- State expands power  
- Jayant Sinha & Samir Saran — “Gated Globalisation”  
- Deglobalisation trends: Brexit, Trump, COVID  
- Resilient supply chains  

---

## Conclusion on Globalisation

**Vinod Rai:** Governance quality more important than extent of globalisation.

---

# Liberal Theory of State

- State arises from social contract  
- Limited state  
- State cannot be forced on man  

### Two Schools

1. **Night-watchman (Classical)**  
   - Locke, Adam Smith, Nozick, Hayek  

2. **Welfare (Modern)**  
   - Laski, T. H. Green, Rawls, Amartya Sen  

---

# Feminist Theory of State

**Catherine MacKinnon — *Feminism Unmodified***

- State is patriarchal  
- Laws perpetuate male dominance  
- Legal feminism failed  
- Ambivalent view:  
  - State is patriarchal  
  - Yet intervention needed for women’s empowerment  
  - “Personal is political”

---

## Final Conclusion

**J. W. Garner:** Political science begins and ends with the state.
