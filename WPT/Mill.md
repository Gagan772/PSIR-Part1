## Revival of Utilitarianism

- Classical utilitarianism (Bentham) → **utility as core value**
- Inspired by **Alexis de Tocqueville**
- Bentham made liberalism majoritarian → against Kant’s categorical imperative
- Led to worker exploitation & inequality
- Thomas Carlyle: “Pig’s philosophy”

### Mill’s Revision

- Shifted core value from **utility → liberty**
- “Better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied”
- Bentham → quantity; Mill → **quality + quantity**
- Pleasure ≠ Happiness  
  - Pleasure = material  
  - Happiness = spiritual
- Utility in widest sense = happiness + pleasure
- Made utilitarianism humane
