---

## Intro

Karl Marx is best known not as a philosopher but as a **revolutionary**, whose works inspired the foundation of many communist regimes in the twentieth century.

---

## Intellectual Influences

- **Hegel** — Dialectics  
- **David Ricardo** — Labour Theory of Value  
- **Louis Blanc** — Revolutionary socialism  

---

## From Hegel to Marx

### Hegel — Dialectical Idealism
- Ideas are moving force of history  
- History progresses through dialectics of ideas  
- Three laws of dialectics:
  1. Unity of opposites  
  2. Negation of negation  
  3. Quantity changes into quality  

### Marx’s Critique
- Said Hegel is “standing on his head”  
- Turned dialectics from **ideas → material conditions**

---

## Core Marxian Ideas

- Criticised Adam Smith’s laissez-faire  
- Violence is midwife of change  
- Socialism is **scientific** and **praxis-oriented**  
- Goal: **Communism**
- “Workers of the world unite, you have nothing to lose but your chains.”
- “Philosophers have only interpreted the world, what matters is to change it.”

---

## Materialism

- To think, man must eat → must produce  
- Production is first historical act  
- Manual labour prior to mental labour  
- Society formed for production  
- Economy = **basic structure**

---

## Base and Superstructure

- **Base** = economic relations between classes  
- **Superstructure** = family, school, socio-political institutions  
- Superstructure reflects base  
- Class controlling base controls superstructure  

---

## State

- Hegel → state represents universal altruism  
- Marx → state = class institution, tool of bourgeois coercion  
- Workers cannot expect justice from such a state  

---

## False Consciousness

- Religion and nationalism = false consciousness  
- Workers must see material conditions  
- Leads to revolutionary consciousness  

---

## True Freedom

- Freedom from basic necessities  
- Communism → state takes care of needs  
- No private property → no profit motive → no competition  

---

## Capitalism’s Contradictions

- Capitalism carries seed of decay  
- Everyone competitor  
- Small capitalists become proletariat  
- Middle class disappears  
- Relative deprivation increases consciousness  
- Worker’s labour strengthens capitalist power  

---

## Historical Materialism

History moves due to relations in production, not ideas.

### Stages of History

1. Primitive communism — no class, no state  
2. Slave society — master vs slave  
3. Feudalism — lord vs serf  
4. Capitalism — capitalist vs worker  
5. Socialism — dictatorship of proletariat  
6. Communism — no class, no state, perfect equality  

---

## Consciousness

- Class in itself  
- Class for itself  

---

## Alienation (Young Marx)

1. From production process  
2. From product  
3. From society  
4. From oneself  

---

## Criticisms

### Non-Marxists

- **Karl Popper** — Reductionist, determinist, unscientific, historicism  
- **Max Weber** — Monocausal explanation  

### Marxists

- **Gramsci** — Underestimated superstructure (culture)  
- **Althusser** — Economic reductionism; multi-structural approach; interpellation  
- **Foucault** — Power not only economic; also patriarchy, heteronormativity

## Conclusion

“That Marx still looms so large in our present world is indeed the measure of his greatness.” — Hannah Arendt
