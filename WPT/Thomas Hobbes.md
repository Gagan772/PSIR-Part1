**Sabine:** No contradiction — absolutism protects individual life.

## State Absolutism

- Monistic sovereignty  
- State supreme in all matters (unlike Bodin)  
- No association can share authority  
- Absolute state means no freedom against state law  

---

## Human Nature

- Man selfish, passion-driven  
- Equality based on passions (vs Locke’s reason)
- Removes guilt for selfishness  
- Life = continuous search for power  
- Leads to competition & anarchy  

**State of Nature:**  
“War of all against all”  
Life: **poor, nasty, brutish and short**

## Scientific Method

- Uses physics, psychology, geometry  

---

## Liberty

- Liberty where law is silent  
- If law exists, no liberty  

---

## Political Obligation

- Based on **consent-contract**  
- Covenant without sword = empty words  
- Sovereign can punish  
- People duty bound to obey  

---

## Leviathan

- All-powerful state  
- Only one sovereign in territory  

---

## Modern Relevance

- Md Ayoob: Nation-state essential (Covid example)  
- UN system = attempt to reduce anarchy

---

## Criticism

- C.B. Macpherson: starts individualist, ends absolutist  
- Laski: Monism unsustainable; federalism reality  
- Marxists: scholar of capitalist class  

### Critics of Social Contract

1. Thomas Paine — cannot bind future generations  
2. Henry Maine — hypothetical  
3. David Hume — self-centered man cannot form contract

## Contemporary Theory

**Narrow Corridor** → “Shackled Leviathan”  
Balance between state & society needed for liberty.
