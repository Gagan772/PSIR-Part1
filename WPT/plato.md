# PLATO

## Introduction

- Father of political philosophy  
- Student of Socrates, teacher of Aristotle  
- Book: **The Republic** — concerning justice  
- Context: wanted to know why Athens lost to Sparta in Peloponnesian War  

---

## Why Athens lost

- Democracy → opposed by Plato  
- Division between rich & poor  
- Elites taught by Sophists  
- Sophists taught money & power > knowledge  
- Populist decisions, not right decisions  
- “Is should govern ought” vs Plato → “Ought should govern is”  

---

## Theory of Ideas

- Derived from Socrates’ knowledge theory  
- Ideas belong to world of God  
- Reality = poor manifestation of ideas  
- Ideas transcendental & unchanging  
- **Allegory of Cave** → Idea is ultimate reality  

---

## Theory of Souls / Myth of Metals (Kallipolis)

Three classes:

1. **Men of Reason (Guardians)** — Gold  
2. **Men of Courage (Auxiliaries)** — Silver  
3. **Men of Appetite (Civilians)** — Copper  

- Natural inequality  
- Silver & copper must follow gold  
- Reason dominates in rulers  

---

## Theory of Communism (for Guardians only)

- To prevent corruption of philosopher king  
- Common property  
- No private ownership  
- No family  
- No nepotism  
- No lust for corruption  
- Would free women  

---

## Plato vs Marx Communism

- Plato = Idealist; Marx = Materialist  
- For Plato idea is ultimate reality  
- Plato class based on worth; Marx class based on economy  
- Plato supports state supremacy; Marx calls for revolution  
- Plato no violent talk; Marx supports violence  

---

## Philosopher King

- “Until philosophers are rulers…”  
- One man institution  
- Against democracy  
- Ruler reluctant to rule  
- Symbol of knowledge & sacrifice  

### Problem

- Power corrupts  
- Needs checks & balances  
- Ashoka example  

---

## Theory of Justice

- Justice = functional specialisation  
- Everyone doing right duty  
- Hierarchical justice  
- Knowledge supreme  
- Justice superior to power  
- Outcome → peaceful society  

**Interlinking**

- Plato & Aristotle → meritocratic  
- Rawls → egalitarian  
- Sabine: justice is bond of society  
- Barker: Plato’s thought revolves around justice

## Theory of Education

- 50 years process  
- State-sponsored  
- Strict oversight  
- Women can be educated  
- Philosophy, literature, maths, military training  
- Produces philosopher king  

---

## State is Individual Writ Large

- Politics + ethics continuity  
- Just individuals → just state  
- Principles same at individual & state level  

---

## Plato as First Feminist

- Women capable of education  
- Philosopher queen  
- Some say service to state motive  

---

## “No law is mightier than knowledge”

- Law = average wisdom  
- Philosopher king = true knowledge  
- Law rigid, king flexible  

### Criticism

- Law = reason without passion  
- Aristotle → law superior to one person  
- Risk of despotism  
- Plato later moved to rule of law (*The Laws*)
