# Totalitarianism  
**Book: *The Origins of Totalitarianism***

- State gains total control

### Formula

**Terror + Ideology + Propaganda = Totalitarian System**

- No public sphere → no truth-testing

- No empirical observation  
- Not subject to logic

- People lose enquiry and creativity

## Ending Totalitarianism

- Reclaim public sphere  
- Civil disobedience  
- Freedom = capacity to do something new → establish democratic order

## Critique of Modernity

- Reduced man to economic sphere  
- Citizens delegate responsibility to politicians  
- Leads to disappearance of public sphere and rise of bureaucratic state  
- Democracy without political culture → directionless democracy  
- Fear & instability make people vulnerable to totalitarian ideology  

**Quote:**  
“When people are atomised, a strongman arises…”

| Work (Homo faber) | Economic production | Partial freedom |
| Action (Zoon politikon) | Political participation | True human freedom |
