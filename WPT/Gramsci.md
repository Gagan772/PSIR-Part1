# Antonio Gramsci

---

## Intro

- Wrote thoughts in **Prison Notebooks**
- Most original thinker in Western Marxism after Marx
- Father of **Neo-Marxism**

---

## Context

- Contemporary of Mussolini
- Question: Why did Marxist prediction of collapse of capitalism not come true?
- Capitalism survived through **mental hegemony**

---

## Neo-Marxism

- Inspired by **Young Marx**
- Aim: **Human emancipation**, not just economic revolution
- Need to escape **mental hegemony** of capitalists
- Hegemony created via **state, civil society, church**
- Called **theoretician of superstructure**

---

## Influence

- **Benedetto Croce** — role of press and journals in shaping ideology

---

## Core Ideas — Cultural Hegemony

- Marx overemphasised base, undermined superstructure
- Dominant class controls society through **indoctrinated common sense**
- Bourgeois values become worker values
- Organic intellectuals create hegemony

---

## State and Civil Society

- Civil society = first layer of protection of capitalism  
- State = second layer (coercion)
- Civil society manufactures consent through:
  - Family  
  - School  
  - Church  
- Legitimises bourgeois rule
- State coercion used only when hegemony fails

---

## Why No Revolution in West

- Russia 1917 easier (weak civil society)
- West → strong civil society, state appears opaque
- Workers attracted to capitalist values
- Similar to **Sanskritisation** (M.N. Srinivas)

---

## Coalition of Classes

- Revolution needs alliance of classes
- Like capitalists ally with church, intellectuals

---

## Soft Power

- USA rules via Hollywood, Silicon Valley, Harvard
- Inspiration for idea of **soft power**

---

## Manufacturing Consent

- Noam Chomsky — media supports elites

---

## Strategy Against Capitalism

### 1. War of Position
- Build **counter-hegemony**
- Long ideological struggle
- Workers need **organic intellectuals**
- Traditional intellectuals can be co-opted

### 2. War of Manoeuvre
- Direct action
- Example: Quit India Movement

---

## Schools of Neo-Marxism

### Critical / Frankfurt School
- Culture central in superstructure
- Mass culture creates passivity
- Herbert Marcuse → false needs
- Adorno, Horkheimer → capitalism survives via culture

### Structural School
- Inspired by Poulantzas
- Superstructure autonomous
- Relationship between base & superstructure is reflexive

---

## Criticism

- **Althusser** — ignores coercive state apparatus
- **Foucault** — power is multidimensional; micro power

---

## Conclusion

N. Bobbio calls him **theoretician of superstructure**. Gramsci revived Marxism through concept of hegemony.
