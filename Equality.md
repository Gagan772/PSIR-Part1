# Relationship between Equality and Freedom

## Intro

- Equality means **“absence of privilege”**  
- It is a **loaded** and **contested** concept in political science  
- Multiple interpretations:  
  - Formal equality  
  - Moral equality  
  - Equality of resources  
  - Equality of welfare  
  - Equality of opportunity

## Ronald Dworkin — Equality of Resources (Distributive Justice)

- Book: **Sovereign Virtue** → Equality is the *sovereign virtue*  
- Just society = **initial distribution of resources is just**  
- Focus: **Resource egalitarianism**  
- Main concern: **Initial distribution**

### Key Concepts

- **Brute Luck** → No choice → State should compensate  
- **Option Luck** → Choice involved → No compensation  
- Person should not be held responsible for circumstances not chosen  

---

## Criticism of Dworkin

1. **Amartya Sen — Capability Approach**  
   - Equal resources ≠ Equal outcomes  
   - Capability (internal ability) more important than resources  
   - Example: Literacy (capability) vs Books (resource)

2. **Michael Walzer**  
   - Equality is complex  
   - “Blocking exchanges” between spheres  
   - Inequality in one sphere must not affect another  

3. **Communitarian View**  
   - Too much emphasis on choice  
   - Ambitions shaped by community  

4. Difficult to distinguish **bad luck vs bad choice**  

5. Should we not help someone who made a bad decision?  

6. Theory is **complex, idealistic, vague**

## Dworkin vs Rawls

- Thinner veil of ignorance  
- Distinguishes brute luck vs option luck  
- Normative equality vs Rawls’ procedural justice  
- Rawls → Equality of opportunity  
- Dworkin → Equality of resources  

---

## Dworkin vs Nozick

- Nozick → First possession = ownership  
- Dworkin → Fair insurance market for misfortune  
- Nozick → No state obligation to help worst off  

---

## Iris Marion Young

- Calls for **differentiated equality**  
- Supports **affirmative action** at initial distribution  

---

## Marxist View

- Liberal equality = formal/procedural  
- Call for **substantive equality**  
- Focus on **equality of outcome**

---

## Conclusion Quote

**Alexis de Tocqueville** — History of human society = expanding idea of equality

# Equality and Liberty

- Equality = absence of privilege  
- Liberty = freedom to do what one wants  
- Origin: American & French Revolutions  
- Socialists → Equality > Liberty  
- Capitalists → Liberty > Equality  

---

## F. A. Hayek

- Inequality naturally emerges  
- State should not enforce equality of outcome  
- Social justice = mirage  
- Liberty must be protected  

---

## Rawls — Reconciliation

- Inequality justified only if it benefits least advantaged (**Difference Principle**)  
- Liberty first (lexical order)  
- Two conditions:  
  - Fair equality of opportunity  
  - Difference principle  

- Aristotle & Rawls → Proportionate equality  
- Marx & Gramsci → Absolute equality  
- Amartya Sen → Liberty meaningless without capability equality  
- Equality essential for freedom  

---

## Equality as Impediment to Liberty

- Equality gives state power to curb liberty  
- Equality of outcome reduces incentive  
- Lower resources → More inequality  

### Reason for Conflict

- Scarcity of resources  
- Equality = outcome vs Liberty = choice  
- Both equated with fairness  

### Complementary View

- Herbert A. Dean → Both part of same ideal  
- Indian government reconciles through **affirmative action (reservation)**  
- Fukuyama → End of history (liberalism wins)  
- Thomas Piketty → Growing inequality threatens freedom  

---

## Final Conclusion

- **Laski & MacPherson** → Equality and liberty are complementary  
- Laski: Those who oppose equality in name of liberty misunderstand liberty
