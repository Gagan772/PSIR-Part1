## Ronald Dworkin — Equality of Resources (Distributive Justice)

- Book: **Sovereign Virtue** → Equality is the *sovereign virtue*  
- Just society = **initial distribution of resources is just**  
- Focus: **Resource egalitarianism**  
- Main concern: **Initial distribution**

### Key Concepts

- **Brute Luck** → No choice → State should compensate  
- **Option Luck** → Choice involved → No compensation  
- Person should not be held responsible for circumstances not chosen  

---

## Criticism of Dworkin

1. **Amartya Sen — Capability Approach**  
   - Equal resources ≠ Equal outcomes  
   - Capability (internal ability) more important than resources  
   - Example: Literacy (capability) vs Books (resource)

2. **Michael Walzer**  
   - Equality is complex  
   - “Blocking exchanges” between spheres  
   - Inequality in one sphere must not affect another  

3. **Communitarian View**  
   - Too much emphasis on choice  
   - Ambitions shaped by community  

4. Difficult to distinguish **bad luck vs bad choice**  

5. Should we not help someone who made a bad decision?  

6. Theory is **complex, idealistic, vague**

## Dworkin vs Rawls

- Thinner veil of ignorance  
- Distinguishes brute luck vs option luck  
- Normative equality vs Rawls’ procedural justice  
- Rawls → Equality of opportunity  
- Dworkin → Equality of resources  

---

## Dworkin vs Nozick

- Nozick → First possession = ownership  
- Dworkin → Fair insurance market for misfortune  
- Nozick → No state obligation to help worst off  

---

## Iris Marion Young

- Calls for **differentiated equality**  
- Supports **affirmative action** at initial distribution  

---

## Marxist View

- Liberal equality = formal/procedural  
- Call for **substantive equality**  
- Focus on **equality of outcome**

---

## Conclusion Quote

**Alexis de Tocqueville** — History of human society = expanding idea of equality

# Equality and Liberty

- Equality = absence of privilege  
- Liberty = freedom to do what one wants  
- Origin: American & French Revolutions  
- Socialists → Equality > Liberty  
- Capitalists → Liberty > Equality  

---

## F. A. Hayek

- Inequality naturally emerges  
- State should not enforce equality of outcome  
- Social justice = mirage  
- Liberty must be protected  

---

## Rawls — Reconciliation

- Inequality justified only if it benefits least advantaged (**Difference Principle**)  
- Liberty first (lexical order)  
- Two conditions:  
  - Fair equality of opportunity  
  - Difference principle  

- Aristotle & Rawls → Proportionate equality  
- Marx & Gramsci → Absolute equality  
- Amartya Sen → Liberty meaningless without capability equality  
- Equality essential for freedom  

---

## Equality as Impediment to Liberty

- Equality gives state power to curb liberty  
- Equality of outcome reduces incentive  
- Lower resources → More inequality  

### Reason for Conflict

- Scarcity of resources  
- Equality = outcome vs Liberty = choice  
- Both equated with fairness  

### Complementary View

- Herbert A. Dean → Both part of same ideal  
- Indian government reconciles through **affirmative action (reservation)**  
- Fukuyama → End of history (liberalism wins)  
- Thomas Piketty → Growing inequality threatens freedom  

---

## Final Conclusion

- **Laski & MacPherson** → Equality and liberty are complementary  
- Laski: Those who oppose equality in name of liberty misunderstand liberty

# Exam Enrichment & Contemporary Relevance

## Contemporary Examples
1.  **Affirmative Action in India**: 
    - **103rd Constitutional Amendment Act**: Introduction of 10% EWS (Economically Weaker Section) quota shifts focus from social to economic backwardness, aligning more with *Dworkin's Resource Egalitarianism*.
    - **Sub-categorization of SC/STs**: Recent Supreme Court discussions on whether states can sub-classify SCs to ensure benefits reach the most marginalized (linking to *Rawls' Difference Principle*).

2.  **Capability Approach (Amartya Sen)**:
    - **Digital Divide**: In the post-COVID world, access to the internet and smartphones is not just a resource/utility but a *capability* essential for education and employment.
    - **HDI vs GDP**: India's focus on 'Viksit Bharat' emphasizes GDP, but low HDI ranking highlights the gap between resource growth and capability enhancement.

3.  **Global Inequality**:
    - **Oxfam Inequality Report**: "Survival of the Richest" highlighting extreme wealth concentration (top 1% own 40% of wealth in India), validating *Marxist critiques* of liberal equality and *Piketty's* warnings.
    - **Vaccine Apartheid**: Unequal access to vaccines during the pandemic serves as a stark example of *global resource inequality*.

4.  **Equality of Outcome vs. Opportunity**:
    - **Freebies vs. Welfare (Revdi Culture debate)**: The debate on whether state handouts (free electricity/bus rides) create dependency (libertarian view) or provide a level playing field (egalitarian view).
    - **Universal Basic Income (UBI)**: Debates around UBI align with Dworkin's idea of the "envy test" and insurance against brute luck.

5.  **Gender Equality**:
    - **Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam (Women's Reservation Bill)**: An example of *substantive equality* (equality of outcome) to correct historical under-representation in politics.

## Key Quotes for Answer Writing
- **Laski**: "Political liberty without economic equality is a myth."
- **R.H. Tawney**: "Equality of opportunity is not simply a matter of legal equality. Its existence depends, not merely on the absence of disabilities, but on the presence of abilities."
- **Voltaire**: "We are all equal as men, but not as members of society."
- **Nelson Mandela**: "As long as poverty, injustice and gross inequality exist in our world, none of us can truly rest."
