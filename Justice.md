# John Rawls — Theory of Justice

---

## Intro

- Justice is the **first virtue of social institutions**  
- Rawls = social liberal + egalitarian  

### Context

- Behaviouralism failed to explain feminist & black rights movements  
- 1971 → Rawls revived political philosophy  

---

## Core Theory

### Social Contract Model

- Contract by **rational, moral, mutually disinterested persons**
- In **Original Position** under **Veil of Ignorance**
- People know rules of society but not their identity
- Aim → Fair distribution of **Primary Goods**

### Primary Goods

- Rights  
- Liberties  
- Opportunities  
- Income  
- Wealth  

---

## Decision Rule — Maximin Principle

Choose system where **worst outcome is better than worst outcome of other systems**.

- Liberalism → risk of being poorest  
- Socialism → risk of being richest but restricted  
- Welfare State → both rich & poor protected  

---

## Rawls on Inequality

- Inequality cannot be eliminated  
- Justice = **managing inequality**, not removing it  
- People differ in talents  
- Calls his model **Democratic Equality**

---

## Nature of Theory

- Purely **procedural**  
- Uses **Reflective Equilibrium** (heart & mind agree)  

---

## Lexical Order of Principles

1️⃣ Equal Liberty  
2️⃣ Equal Opportunity  
3️⃣ Difference Principle  

### Difference Principle

- Inequality allowed only if it benefits **worst-off**
- Compensates natural inequalities (talent by birth)

---

## Managing Inequality

Two options:

- Everyone equal but poor  
- Some richer, but wealth used for welfare of poor  

Poor choose 2nd; Rich agree because **luck** plays role.

Linked to:

- Gandhi’s Talisman  
- DDU’s Antyodaya  
- Progressive taxation  
- Welfare state  

Norman Barry → “Chain Principle” (weakest link matters)

---

## Criticisms

### 1️⃣ Feminists

- Bridges inequality in political sphere, not personal sphere

---

### 2️⃣ Libertarians — Robert Nozick  
**Book:** *Anarchy, State and Utopia*

- Entitlement theory  
- Inequality from competition is just  
- Minimal state  
- Progressive taxation = bonded labour  
- Against welfare state  
- No historical injustice focus  

---

### 3️⃣ Social Liberals

#### Amartya Sen

- Abstract individuals in abstract situation  
- Advocates **social choice** in real situations  
- Grand idea of justice neither possible nor desirable  
- Equal capacity more important than equal goods  

#### Dworkin

- Rawls ignores distinction between **choice vs circumstances**  
- Only brute luck deserves compensation  

---

### 4️⃣ Berlin (Value Pluralism)

- Values are incommensurable  
- Rawls’ lexical order shows value hierarchy  
- Against spirit of pluralism  

---

### 5️⃣ Communitarians

We always see through **community lenses**, not abstract.

#### Alasdair MacIntyre  

#### Charles Taylor  
- Man = situated self  

#### Michael Sandel  
**Book:** *Liberalism and Limits of Justice*

- Man = embedded self  
- Choices shaped by community  

#### Michael Walzer  
**Book:** *Spheres of Justice*

- No universal principles  
- Justice differs across spheres  
- Different goods → different distribution  

---

## Rawls’ Response

### Overlapping Consensus

- People may have different reasons but agree on same political principles  
- Emerges from democratic culture  
- Features: toleration, public reasoning, reciprocity  

### Political Liberalism (Second Book)

- Theory only for **Western societies**  
- Applies to **political sphere only**

---

## Conclusion

Nozick called Rawls a **reference point**.  
His work began the **golden age of justice theory**.
